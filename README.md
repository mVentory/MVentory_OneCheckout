MVentory_OneCheckout
====================



OneCheckout extension streamlines the checkout process.

Address fields, payment methods, shipping methods and totals are visible all the time on the same page with a multicolumn layout.

Dependent information and parts of the checkout page are update via AJAX as more details are entered. E.g. the shipping cost updates itself as the customer finalises the address.

Customers are able to login or register without leaving the page.

There are no special installation or configuration instructions.

Follow the standard installation procedure and update the theme CSS as necessary to match the change of the layout.
